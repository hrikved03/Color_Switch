# 🎨 Color Switcher Project

## 📌 Overview

The **Color Switcher** is a simple interactive web project built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
It allows users to change the webpage background color by clicking on different colored boxes. Additionally, a hover-based interaction is implemented for the orange color box.

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of **DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI interaction** in JavaScript.

## 🚀 Features

* Clickable color boxes to change background color
* Hover-based color switching (orange box)
* Event listeners for user interaction
* Simple and responsive UI
* Beginner-friendly DOM manipulation example

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML** → Structure of the webpage
* **CSS** → Styling and layout of color buttons
* **JavaScript** → Event handling and background color switching

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

### ✅ Click Events

* Each colored box has a unique **ID**
* JavaScript selects all elements with class `.button`
* When clicked, the event listener:

  * Detects the clicked element
  * Reads its ID
  * Changes the `body` background color accordingly

### ✅ Hover Events (Orange Box)

* `mouseenter` → Background changes to orange
* `mouseleave` → Background resets to default color
